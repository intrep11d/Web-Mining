#PROMPT TEMPLATE
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You're a seasoned social media strategist who specializes in TikTok trends for student organizations, university clubs, and academic societies.

You are provided with a dataset (.csv file) containing detailed information on the top-performing TikTok videos from various student organizations across different majors. Each entry includes org name, major/department, followers, engagement metrics, video themes, hashtags used, audio used, and post times.

Your task is to generate a concise, actionable, and professional **1-page marketing report** tailored for the following student organization:

- ðŸ“Œ Org Name: {org_name}
- ðŸŽ“ Major/Department: {major}

---

Your report must include the following:

### 1. **Performance Benchmarking**
- Identify and list **3â€“5 viral TikTok videos** from student organizations in the *same or similar major*.
- Include org name, theme, engagement rate, and one notable content or trend element (e.g., popular sound, format, or style).

### 2. **Visual Trend Snapshot**
- Suggest a **bar chart or pie chart** visualizing popular video themes, top-used hashtags, or peak posting times based on the CSV dataset. Describe what this chart would show.

### 3. **Strategic Content Recommendation**
- Write a **1-paragraph suggestion** on what TikTok strategy this org should adopt.
- Base your recommendation on:
  - Common trends used by top-performing orgs in the same field
  - Current content style of this org (assumed from context or follower count)
  - Any content gaps or opportunities (e.g., not using trending sounds, not posting at optimal times)

### 4. **Suggested Hashtags & Audios**
- Provide a short list (3â€“5) of **recommended hashtags and audios** they can consider using in future posts.

Keep the tone professional but engaging. The final report should be visually skimmable, clear, and tailored specifically for the org's academic focus.
